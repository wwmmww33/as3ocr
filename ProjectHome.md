This app   demonstrates simple handwriting recognition using a Kohonen Neural Network. Try it out! Draw any capital English (Roman) letter and click "Recognize". The app  will attempt to tell you what letter you drew. The program will not be 100% accurate, probably closer to 70%. Additionally it was trained on my handwriting.


to run this app  you need lib http://svn.aswing.org/aswing/
